# Remote Job Locator

## Abstract 
Remote Job Locator is built with React and tested with Cypress. This project was built to create a replicate of a job finder and the API used is from an official job posting site/finder which is [here](https://remotive.com/). As a user you will be able to search for a desired job by either title, location or both. Once you see a posting you might be interested in you can click on the details link and be taken to more details for that specific posting. Users are also able to save postings if they want to come back to them as well as remove them from their saved page if they have no interest or applied for them already.
